# StytchB2BProvider Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the idp_app from using a custom Stytch authentication implementation to using the official StytchB2BProvider from `@stytch/react`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Upgraded `@stytch/vanilla-js` from v3.x to v5.34.0 in both apps
- Added `@stytch/react` v19.10.0 to idp_app for provider support
- Ensured both apps use compatible versions for session sharing

### 2. Implemented StytchB2BProvider
Created new provider wrapper at `/idp_app/src/providers/StytchProvider.tsx`:
- Wraps the entire app with StytchB2BProvider
- Configures cookie options for localhost session sharing
- Uses the same public token as before

### 3. Created New Authentication Hook
Created `/idp_app/src/hooks/useStytchAuth.ts`:
- Uses `useStytchB2BClient` and `useStytchSession` from the React SDK
- Maintains all authentication functionality (login, logout, password reset)
- Preserves return URL handling for SSO flow
- Keeps organization storage in localStorage

### 4. Updated App Structure
- Modified `main.tsx` to wrap App with StytchProvider
- Updated `App.tsx` to use `useStytchSession` hook
- Updated `LoginPage.tsx` to use new `useStytchAuth` hook
- Removed the old AuthProvider context

### 5. Fixed Cookie Configuration
Both apps now use consistent cookie configuration:
```javascript
cookieOptions: {
  domain: 'localhost',
  path: '/',
}
```
This ensures sessions are properly shared between localhost:3000 and localhost:3001.

### 6. Updated dest_app
- Updated to use `StytchB2BClient` instead of deprecated `StytchB2BUIClient`
- Ensured consistent cookie configuration for session sharing

## Key Benefits

1. **Cleaner Code**: Using the official provider pattern reduces custom code
2. **Better Type Safety**: The React SDK provides better TypeScript support
3. **Automatic Session Management**: The provider handles session lifecycle
4. **Consistent with Best Practices**: Follows Stytch's recommended implementation

## SSO Flow Preserved

The SSO flow continues to work as before:
1. Unauthenticated users hitting dest_app redirect to idp_app with return_url
2. After login at idp_app, users redirect back to dest_app
3. Authenticated users can access dest_app directly without redirection
4. Sessions are properly shared between apps via cookies

## Testing

Both apps are running:
- dest_app: http://localhost:3000
- idp_app: http://localhost:3001

The authentication loop issue has been resolved through proper cookie configuration and consistent SDK usage across both applications.
