Session Prompts:

1. User requested using the code-quality-reviewer subagent to review the code in the idp_app directory.

The code quality review identified critical issues:
- Hard-coded public tokens (security vulnerability)
- Failing tests (2 URL validation tests)
- Console.log statements in production code
- Missing ESLint configuration
- Error boundaries exposing stack traces in production

2. User implicitly wanted these issues addressed (context from previous session continuation).

3. User asked to kill both servers after completion.

4. User requested to commit work, add prompts to git notes, push, and create a PR using GitHub MCP integration.

Actions taken:
- Fixed hard-coded public token by moving to environment variables
- Removed all console.log statements from production code
- Fixed failing URL validation tests by properly configuring test environment
- Enhanced ESLint configuration with React and security rules
- Hidden stack traces in production error boundaries
- Fixed all ESLint errors across the codebase
- Successfully ran all tests (43/43 passing)
- Stopped both dev servers as requested
