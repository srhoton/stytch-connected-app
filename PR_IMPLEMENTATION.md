# Pull Request Implementation

This PR implements the complete SSO flow with Stytch B2B authentication between two React applications.

## User Journey
1. User accesses dest_app without authentication
2. Redirected to idp_app for login
3. Authenticates using password or magic link
4. Redirected back to dest_app with session
5. Can access protected content

## Session Prompts
The complete conversation prompts have been preserved in git notes for reference.
