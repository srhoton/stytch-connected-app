User Prompts from Session:

1. "Ok, now for the final step. We want to implement a flow that goes like this: 1. When a user hits dest_app and have *not* logged in, they are directed to idp app. After they log in via idp_app, they are redirected to the main page of dest_app, with the 'access granted' page. 2. If a user is already logged in to dest_app, they are *not* directed to idp_app, and view the 'access_granted' page. Ultrathink this."

2. "Ok. It looks like there is an auth loop somewhere. If I'm logged in on idp_app, going to the the dest_app main page causes a looping where I bounce back and forth between apps."

3. "Ok. Now could you modify the idp_app to use StytchB2BProvider for the login flow, not the custom solution in there now? You could look at this quickstart, or the code in the ../ui-main-web directory to see examples. Ultrathink."

4. "I'm still seeing this error when loading the idp app: [vite] connecting... client.ts:19:9 [vite] connected. client.ts:155:15 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:3001/node_modules/.vite/deps/@stytch_react_b2b.js?v=941efe7a' doesn't provide an export named: 'useStytchB2BSession'"

5. "When the dest_app loads now, the console shows this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:3000/node_modules/.vite/deps/@stytch_vanilla-js_b2b.js?v=c2edc6f5' doesn't provide an export named: 'StytchB2BClient'"

6. "ok. loading the idp_app now throws this error in the console: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module 'http://localhost:3001/node_modules/.vite/deps/@stytch_react_b2b.js?v=941efe7a' doesn't provide an export named: 'useStytchSession'"

7. "nope. Loading idp_app now throws there errors: Uncaught TypeError: can't access property 'self', stytch is undefined"

8. "ok, I can log into the idp_app now. But on the dest_app, it still shows: Session Validation Failed Failed to validate session Please ensure you have a valid Stytch session to access this content. The only message in the console is 'Starting session validation...'"

9. "ok. now back on the idp_app, can we use the <StytchB2B> UI component, to manage the login process, not the vanilla javascript? And, can we wrap the app in <StytchB2BProvider>, like in this example? https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/quickstarts/react. Ultrathink."

10. "Opening the idp_app now throws this error in the console: vite] connecting... client.ts:19:9 [vite] connected. client.ts:155:15 Uncaught TypeError: can't access property 'self', stytch is undefined"

11. "ok. Now hitting the idp_app has no errors in the console, but this is the message in the UI: Looks like there was an error! The organization you are looking for could not be found. If you think this is a mistake, contact your admin."

12. "ok, now the idp_app does not load, and this is in the console: Uncaught TypeError: can't access property 0, _a.providers is undefined"

13. "ok, that works. Could you add magic link functionality to the config as well?"

14. "ok. Please commit your work, add prompts in this session to the commit via git notes, push it, and using your github mcp integration, create a PR."
